To configure global Git settings, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` to set your name as the global Git username.
3. Type `git config --global user.email "your@email.com"` to set your email address as the global Git email.
4. Optionally, you can also configure other settings such as your preferred text editor or default branch name using the `git config` command.

Remember to replace "Your Name" and "your@email.com" with your actual name and email address.

Once you have configured the global Git settings, you can start using Git for version control in your projects.
